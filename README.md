There are lots of fake tokens on Cardano, and sometimes it's too late for those tokens to be taken down from Cardano Token Registry. That's why the Cardano Galactic Police will try to update those tokens in here as soon as possible to prevent abuses.

We keep a list of suspecious tokens policy IDs in `suspicious-tokens.txt` file, one policy ID is one line.

Cardano applications and DEXes are free to use this list to warn or block users from interacting with suspicious tokens.

Moreover, we will display a blue check mark on our side based on `verified-tokens.txt` file. This file can protect users when they buy/sell any token, they can be noticed by Minswap before they do it.
